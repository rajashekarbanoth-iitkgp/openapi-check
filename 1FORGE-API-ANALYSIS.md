# 1Forge Finance API Test Results

## Summary

The 1Forge Finance API test was created based on the swagger specification provided, but revealed that **the API endpoints are not functioning as documented**.

## Swagger Documentation vs Reality

### According to Swagger File:
- **Base URL**: `https://1forge.com/forex-quotes`
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /symbols` - Get list of forex symbols
  - `GET /quotes` - Get forex quotes for all symbols
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Response Format**: JSON
- **Example Response**: Array of strings like `["EURUSD", "GBPJPY", "AUDUSD"]`

### Actual API Behavior:
- ❌ **Returns HTML instead of JSON**: All endpoints return a website/Angular app
- ❌ **Status 200 but wrong content type**: `text/html; charset=UTF-8` instead of `application/json`
- ❌ **Endpoints appear to not exist**: The API seems to have changed or been discontinued

## Test Results

✅ **What Works:**
- Schema validation with Zod
- Mock data generation for testing purposes
- Error handling and detection of HTML responses
- Performance measurement (response times ~220ms)
- Proper logging and result tracking

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**
- Actual API endpoints don't return JSON data
- Cannot retrieve real forex symbols or quotes
- Swagger documentation appears outdated

## Generated Mock Data

Since the real API doesn't work, the tester generates mock data for demonstration:

**Mock Symbols**: `['EURUSD', 'GBPJPY', 'AUDUSD', 'USDJPY', 'GBPUSD', 'USDCHF', 'NZDUSD', 'EURGBP']`

**Mock Quote Structure**:
```json
{
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "price": 1.2345,
  "bid": 1.2344,
  "ask": 1.2346,
  "timestamp": 1722343415838
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **API Documentation**: The swagger file appears to be outdated or incorrect
2. **Alternative APIs**: Consider using other forex APIs like:
   - Alpha Vantage
   - Fixer.io
   - Exchange Rates API
   - CurrencyAPI
3. **Contact Provider**: Reach out to 1forge.com for updated API documentation
4. **Use Mock Mode**: The test framework can be used with mock data for development/testing

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the 1Forge API tester
bun run test:1forge-advanced

# View detailed logs
cat logs/1forge-test-*.log
```

## Files Generated

- `advanced-1forge-tester.js` - Complete test suite with Zod schema validation
- `schemas.js` - Updated with 1Forge-specific schemas
- Log files with detailed API call results
- JSON results file with test summary

## Technical Implementation

The tester includes:
- ✅ HTTP request handling with proper error detection
- ✅ Content-type validation (detects HTML vs JSON)
- ✅ Zod schema validation for data structures
- ✅ Mock data generation using zod-schema-faker
- ✅ Performance testing and timing
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and result tracking
- ✅ Graceful handling of API failures

This demonstrates how to build robust API testers that can handle real-world scenarios where APIs may not work as documented.
